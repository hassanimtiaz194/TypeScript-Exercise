/* Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests.
Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
Your code should look something like this:

let car = 'subaru';
console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
console.log(car == 'subaru')
â€¢ Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
â€¢ Create at least 10 tests.Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False. */
